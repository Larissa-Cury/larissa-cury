### E-commerce Sales Project 
<img align="right" width="500" height="320" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dP7f8_ORmpAoVGIVIE5zeCCNPmubNNJJ">
This project analysis a 3-year interval data of a fictionous e-commerce company especilized in the Pet Market. The pet shop especializes in 5 different product categories (food, snacks, medicine, toys and hygine), for which the company offers 10 different products. The pet shop has delivery deals with 5 distribution centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in 5 different regions of the city (South, North, West, "Baixada Fluminense" and Downtown).
<br><br>

* The project aims to demonstrate some of my skills with `R`, `SQL` and `Power Bi` along with my critical and analytical thinking skills. I broke it down into sections to improve organization and readability. 
* I carefully wrote a README for the project's GitHub Repository, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/Larissa-Cury/E-commerceProject/tree/main" target="_blank">HERE</a>

###  Data Analysis Projects 

* I was responsible for the data analysis section of the following articles, which were published in well-known peer-review journals. All analysis were made in `R` with `RSTUDIO` IDE.
* For these articles, I was responsible for
   - `Extracting` and `cleaning` the data;
   - Performing `exploratory data analysis`;
   - Obtaining `Descriptive Statistics`;
   - Performing `correlational analysis` as well as `partial correlations`;
   - Performing `multiple regression models` with random slopes;
   - `Data visualization` with tables and diverse setting of plots, such as scatter and boxplots;
   - `Reporting` the data analysis procedures in the articles' `Data Analysis` Sections;
   - `Describing` and `reporting` both descriptive and inferential data analysis in the articles' `Results` sections
